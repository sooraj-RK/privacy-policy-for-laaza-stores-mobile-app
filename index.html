    <h1>Policy for Lazza Stores</h1> 

    
   <h4>Lazza Stores is a mobile application developed for and on behalf of Lazza Ice Creams, and maintained by Oxium Tech Consultancy. This app is intended solely for use by authorized partners and store staff for organizational purposes, including placing ice cream orders from distributors, submitting freezer modification requests, and applying for branding support.

This application does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data. There is no user registration, login, or account creation process. The app is designed to function without capturing any personal identifiers or private information from users.

The app may use internet connectivity to submit operational data (such as product requests or form submissions), but this data does not include personal or sensitive information. We do not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking services.

Since the app does not collect personal data, there is no information available for users to access, update, or delete. If this changes in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly and communicated to users.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy or the app, please contact us at developer@oxiumtech.com.
